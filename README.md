# Astronautics Terminology Catalog
A cataloging, comparison and examination of terms and definitions in astronautics (spaceflight).

## About
This provides a living catalog of broad but key terms, both generic and specific, and their definitions associated with the disciplines of spaceflight, orbital debris & space situational awareness (SSA), space domain awareness, and space traffic management (stm). The catalog, in MS Excel format, provides a listing of terms (with definitions from various sources) such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc. 
This is a task in the author's Astonautical Knowledge Modeling project, and related ontology projects by Robert Rovetto.

## Goals
- to provide a non-exhaustive catalog of astronautical terms and definitions as a general reference
- a semantic and conceptual analysis to help inform the development of ontologies for astronautics (see other repositories by rrovetto).
- to identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions

## Access
