# Astronautics Terminology Catalog
A living collection, comparison and examination of generic but key terms and definitions in astronautics (spaceflight).

## Goals
- To provide a non-exhaustive catalog of key astronautical terms and definitions as a general reference
- A semantic, conceptual and ontological analysis to help inform the development of knowledge modeling and terminological systems such as ontologies for astronautics (see other GitHub repositories by [rrovetto](https://github.com/rrovetto)
- To help improve existing knowledge organization systems.
- To identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions across documents, sources, and organizations (and to contribute to their improvement).
- To offer a consistence, coherent, and accurate knowledge model or vocabulary, where desired. 

## Status
In-progress, and no claims to completeness.
This work is currently unfunded and pursued in the authors own time while actively needing a career-path and study opportunity. 
Therefore, if you find value in my work, please consider donating or offering formal support (such as a PhD studentship, a contractor job, or being a sponsor).

## About
This work provides a living catalog of broad but key terms (and their definitions from various sources) associated with the disciplines of spaceflight, orbital debris & space situational awareness (SSA), space domain awareness, and space traffic management (STM) or space traffic coordination (STC). The catalog is in Microsoft Excel format, and provides a listing of terms such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc. It is a task in the author's [Astonautical Knowledge Modeling project](https://purl.org/space-ontology), and related ontology/taxonomy projects by Robert Rovetto. This has been unfunded work pursued in spare time, while volunteering for the aerospace community, but while searching for a career path, and needing a job or studentship opportunity. The author is searching for a PhD study opportunity, employer, or funding to support this and [related](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) work. As an unfunded effort, donations and sponsors are welcome.

## Access
- The file(s) is expected to be added to this repository (TBD).
- This work is currently pursued out-of-pocket. It is highly time-consuming and painstaking work, and a burden while seeking opportunities. Therefore, financial support is needed to sustain and to justify release it. Please consider formally supporting the effort so that service-to-discipline can continue to contribute to the goal of safe spaceflight for all. 
- The working catalog (in Microsoft Excel) is presently located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxThyvuY_VzVl_VNan9cqTsdI6NrYWgX/view?usp=sharing)
