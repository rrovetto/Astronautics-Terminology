# Astronautics Terminology Catalog
A cataloging, comparison and examination of terms and definitions in astronautics (spaceflight).

## About
This provides a living catalog of broad but key terms, both generic and specific, and their definitions associated with the disciplines of spaceflight, orbital debris & space situational awareness (SSA), space domain awareness, and space traffic management (stm). The catalog, in MS Excel format, provides a listing of terms (with definitions from various sources) such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc. 
This is a task in the author's Astonautical Knowledge Modeling project, and related ontology projects by Robert Rovetto.

## Goals
- to provide a non-exhaustive catalog of astronautical terms and definitions as a general reference
- a semantic and conceptual analysis to help inform the development of ontologies for astronautics (see other repositories by rrovetto), and to help improve limitations of existing knowledge organization systems.
- to identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions across documents/sources/organizations, and contribute to their improvement.
- to consist, coherent, and accurate knowledge model or voabulary, where desired. 

## Access
- The working catalog (in Microsoft Excel) is located [at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxThyvuY_VzVl_VNan9cqTsdI6NrYWgX/view?usp=sharing)
- The file(s) is expected to be added to this repository (TBD).
