# Astronautics Terminology Catalog
A living collection, comparison and examination of generic but key terms and definitions in astronautics (spaceflight).

## Goals
- To provide a non-exhaustive catalog of key generic astronautical terms and their definitions (as a general reference).
- To identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions found in the literature, particularly standards organization documents (and to recommend improvements).
- A semantic, conceptual and ontological analysis to help inform the development of knowledge modeling and terminological systems such as [ontologies for astronautics (see other GitHub repositories by rrovetto](https://github.com/rrovetto))
- To offer a consistence, coherent, and accurate knowledge model or vocabulary, where desired. 
- To help improve existing knowledge organization systems for space.

## Status
* In-progress, and no claims to completeness.
* Currently unfunded and pursued in the authors own time. As an unfunded project, [donations and sponsors are welcome](https://tinyurl.com/y9qegjsh).

## About
This work provides a living catalog of broad but key terms (and their definitions from various sources) associated with the disciplines of spaceflight, orbital debris & space situational awareness (SSA), space domain awareness, and space traffic management (STM) or space traffic coordination (STC). The catalog is in Microsoft Excel format, and provides a listing of terms such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc. 

It is a task in the author's [Astonautical Knowledge Modeling project](https://purl.org/space-ontology), and related ontology/taxonomy projects by Robert Rovetto. This has been unsupported work, pursued by the author while also volunteering for the community, but while also currently needing a career-path, a employment, or a studentship opportunity. 

## Support - How you can help
* If you find value in this work, please support it financially or offer the author a PhD study or employment opportunity for this and [related](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) projects.

* As an aspiring student, actively searching for a university program, please consider inviting me to enroll as your student to do this and related work.
* This work is currently pursued out-of-pocket. It is highly time-consuming and painstaking work, and a burden while needing opportunities. Therefore, financial support is needed to sustain and to justify release it. Please consider formally supporting the effort so that service-to-discipline can continue, and contribute to the goal of safe spaceflight for all.
