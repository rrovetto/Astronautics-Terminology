# Astronautics Vocabulary
A cataloging and examination of terms and definitions in astronautics (spaceflight). This is a task in the Astonautical Knowledge Modeling project, and related ontology projects by Robert Rovetto.

## About
This provides a living catalog of many generic and specific key terms relevant for disciplines of spaceflight, orbital debris & space situational awareness (SSA), space domain awareness, and space traffic management (stm) has been in-progress. The catalog provides a listing of terms (with definitions from various sources) such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc.

## Goals
- to provide said catalog as a general reference
- a semantic and conceptual analysis to help inform the development of ontologies for astronautics (see other repositories by rrovetto).
- to identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions

- A working catalog (MSExcel file) is located "[at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxThyvuY_VzVl_VNan9cqTsdI6NrYWgX/view?usp=sharing)"
