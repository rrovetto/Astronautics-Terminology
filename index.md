## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rrovetto/Astronautics-Terminology/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rrovetto/Astronautics-Terminology/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Astronautics Terminology Catalog
## About
This work provides a living catalog, collecting broad but key terms (and their definitions from various sources) associated with the disciplines of astronautics/spaceflight, space situational awareness (SSA), and space traffic management and coordination. It also provides a living analysis toward developing products and recommendations for the community, aiming for terminological harmonization, semantic interoperability, and ontology development (for the latter [see this](https://ontospace.wordpress.com). The term catalog provides a listing of terms such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc. [Contact here](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact).
### Goals
- To provide a non-exhaustive catalog of key generic terms and their various definitions (to serve as a general reference).
- To examine and compare terms and those definitions. 
- To identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions found in the literature, particularly standards organization documents
- To recommend improvements or changes
- A semantic, conceptual and ontological analysis to help inform the development of knowledge modeling and terminological systems such as [ontologies for astronautics (see other GitHub repositories by rrovetto](https://github.com/rrovetto))
- To offer a consistence, coherent, and accurate knowledge model or vocabulary, where desired. 
- To help improve existing knowledge organization systems for space.
### Status
* In-progress, subject to revision, and no claims to completeness.
* Currently unfunded. As a personal project, [donations, sponsors and formal work collaborations are welcome, needed and appreciated](https://tinyurl.com/y9qegjsh).

### Broader applicability & Associated projects
- It is a task in the author's [Astronautical/Space Knowledge Modeling project](https://purl.org/space-ontology), and related ontology/taxonomy projects by [Robert Rovetto](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3835-7817).
- Some content used in the AIAA Space Traffic Management Working Group Lexicon sub-group
- Some content used in International Astronautical Federation (IAF), Space Traffic Management Technical Committee.
## Access
- The file(s) is expected to be added to this repository (TBD), possibly when funding/formal support is attained.
- The working catalog (in Microsoft Excel) is presently located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxThyvuY_VzVl_VNan9cqTsdI6NrYWgX/view?usp=sharing)
