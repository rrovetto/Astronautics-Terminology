## About the Catalog of Astronautical Terminology
This work provides a living catalog, collecting broad but key terms (and their definitions from various sources) associated with the disciplines of astronautics/spaceflight, space situational awareness (SSA), and space traffic management and coordination. It also will provide a living caparative analysis toward products and recommendations for the community, aiming for terminological synchronization, semantic interoperability, and ontology development. For ontnology dev., [see this project](https://ontospace.wordpress.com). The listing of terms includes: 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', 'space', 'spacecraft', 'orbit', etc. [Contact here](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact). Example sources include aerospace literature, documents from standards organizations, space agency docs., etc.

### Goals
- To provide a non-exhaustive catalog of key generic terms and their various definitions (serving as a general reference).
- To examine and compare terms and those definitions (semantic, conceptual analysis). 
- To identify inaccuracies & errors
- To make recommendations for improvements or changes
- To create vocabularies for stakeholders, whether bespoke services or pre-made
- To inform the development of the knowledge modeling activities, e.g., [the authors ontologies for astronautics](https://purl.org/space-ontology)
- To offer consistence, coherent, and accurate knowledge models or vocabulary, where desired. 
- To help improve existing knowledge organization systems for space.
